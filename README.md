# Top-Choices
Distributes students among a set of courses based on their predilection.

Ideally students would fill out a Google Form which requests their basic student information. (First name, Last name, EmplID, and email).
The students are then asked to rank from 1st - Nth, the course they would like to be a part of. 1st is the course they'd most like to take, N is the total number of courses.
The person doing the distribution would download this form, and select this form when the program is launched.
The program will distribute the students, attempting to give everyone their first choice, while also ensuring an even distribution among all the courses.
A report will be generated with basic stats on how successful the distribution was.
